# RusticExpression

### Introduction

Parse and execute simple math operations.

RusticExpression is a .NET (C#) code that allows you to parse and execute simple expressions. I made it for fun in the evening and weekends, but it seems to have grown stable enough for me to share with people.
		
The primary purpose of the code was the self-proposed challenge to create an expression parser without a binary tree. Well, I believe I pretty succeeded in that, but of course, it ended up with a kind of "rustic" tree structure, thus the name.
